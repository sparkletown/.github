  - > The Github Organization Manager lets you define your standards in one place and enforce them throughout your organization. It lets you define a default standard that will apply to every repository, or a variety of standards that you can apply to different repositories based on their needs. When a new repository is created these standards will automatically apply, saving admins from dealing with manual setup each time.
